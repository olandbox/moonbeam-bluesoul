        <p class="pb-4">Ontology land (OLAND) is the entrance of Web3. It replaces "domain name access" by "content access". Each OLAND is an NFT. Anyone can edit the content and relationship corresponding to OLAND, and finally build it into a semantic web, complete the underlying framework of knowledge + reasoning, and become a "The Human Brain". </p>
        <p>The owner of OLAND can permanently own the display area of the corresponding content and the incentive share equity generated by future content editing.</p>
